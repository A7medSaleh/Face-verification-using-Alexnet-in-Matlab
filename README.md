A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet) are a special kind of multi-layer neural networks, designed to recognize visual patterns directly from pixel images with minimal preprocessing. in 2012, AlexNet significantly outperformed all the prior competitors and won the challenge by reducing the top-5 error from 26% to 15.3%.

This code uses pretrained Alexnet deep learning model by retraining the model to many users face images to do face recognition and face verification as shown in the video.
